Python Crash Course Notes

Naming convention:
- variables: lowercase, must begin with underscore or letter, labels assigned to values
- constants: all caps

Variable types:
- string: series of characters inside quotation marks ("" or '' where choice based on whether ' or " used within string)
    - f-string: use f"{}" to insert variable into string, can type in strings and use methods, previously format() method
- integer: use _ to improve readability
- float: given in any operation involving a float or division, use _ to improve 

Lists: 
- collection of items in a particular order
- example_list = [x, y]
- index: starts at 0, -1 is last, example_list[0].title() to access item and change capitalisation

Methods:
- actions python performs on a piece of data
- variable.method()
- title(), lower(), upper() to change case
- rstrip(), lstrip(), strip() to remove whitespace around string
- append(value), insert(index, value), pop(index), remove(value) to edit lists where remove(value) only removes first occurence

Keywords:
- del obj_name to delete an object

Formatting:
- \t for tab
- \n for new line

Multiple assignment:
- e.g. x, y, z = 0, 0, 0
